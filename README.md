Memory Game!
============

This is the classic card-flip memory game.  Flip two cards at a time to try to
match the same cards.  If the two cards do not match, they will flip back over
and you'll have to try again.  Once you match all cards the game is over and
you will receive a score.  

Points are awarded based on how many times each card is flipped:

* One Flip: 10 Points
* Two Flips: 5 Points
* Three Flips: 3 Points
* Four or More Flips: -5 Points

This game is nothing special - I just needed an excuse to play with
react-hot-loader and webpack!
