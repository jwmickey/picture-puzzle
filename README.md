Picture Puzzle!
============

This is the classic picture slider puzzle.  The puzzle is split into 
a grid of squares with the object being to move squares around until 
they are in the original order, resulting in the original picture.

In this version the blank square should always end up in the bottom 
right corner when finished.

To move squares, click a square above, below, or beside the blank square to 
move it to the blank position.  You can also use the up/down/left/right arrow 
keys to move the blank tile.  Note that on a physical board, you would instead move 
the tile that is free to slide in the direction of the blank space.  I had 
implemented this behavior at first, but found it much more intuitive to "move" the 
blank square so that the keyboard inputs would not be reversed.
